# YAIM904 d00b Core

---

## 📌 Description

**YAIM904 d00b Core** is a **required support MOD** for other YAIM904 mods.

By itself, this MOD does **not add new items, machines, or gameplay mechanics**. Its purpose is to work silently in the background and make sure other YAIM904 mods run correctly, smoothly and with maximum compatibility.

If you are using any MOD from the **YAIM904** series, this core MOD provides:

* Shared systems used by all YAIM904 mods
* Better compatibility with large overhaul mods
* Safer loading and fewer conflicts between mods
* Consistent behavior across different saves and mod packs

You can think of this MOD as the **engine behind the scenes**: players normally don’t interact with it directly, but it is essential for other mods to function properly.

## ⚠️ Warnings & Usage Notes

* ❗ Do **not remove or disable** it if another YAIM904 MOD depends on it
* ❗ Removing it from an existing save may break other YAIM904 mods
* ✔ Safe to use in any mod pack
* ✔ Designed to be compatible with most major overhaul mods
